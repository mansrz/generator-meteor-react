## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-meteor-react from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-meteor-react
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
mkdir myAmazingApp
cd myAmazingApp
yo meteor-react
sh startup.sh
```



To add a View:

```bash
yo meteor-react:view [yourViewName]
```

To add a Collection:

```bash
yo meteor-react:collection [yourCollectionName]
```

To add a React component:

```bash
yo meteor-react:component [yourComponentName]
```


### Why React components with Meteor?

Because it's easier to port a Meteor prototype to an enterprise CMS such as Sitecore, AEM or Backbase using React components.. React.js provides a common separation of the View that can be almost dropped onto another implementation



### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
